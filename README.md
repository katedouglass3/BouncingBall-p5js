# BouncingBall-p5js
This is a website to host a p5 project. My p5js editor for this repository
[https://editor.p5js.org/katedouglass3/sketches/bRhL4bOQ7]. This program generates a video of group of random
sized and colored balls bouncing around a predefined window. My code is adapted from Professor Meng's original program.
I made the following changes:

  My first change was to make the balls change color every time they hit a wall or the text block in the corner.

  My second change was making the Hello World! block more exciting. I changed the rectangle into a star using 
  example code I found on the p5js.org website. I then changed the text to say SUN! and changed the font to beimpact so
  that they both match the shape better.
 
  My final change was with the sounds. I changed the background sound to be a soothing river noise I found. I then added a pop
  noise anytime a ball hits the wall or the sun block.
  
The website that runs the program is at [https://github.com/katedouglass3/BouncingBall-p5js].
